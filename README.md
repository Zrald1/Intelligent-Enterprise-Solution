# CATOG Intelligent Enterprise Solution
## High-Performance AI Orchestration with Gemini & LobsterTrap Security

CATOG is an advanced, AI-powered enterprise automation platform built with **Tauri**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. It is designed to act as an intelligent enterprise knowledge assistant, merging world-class reasoning with industrial-grade security.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence: Google Gemini Engine

CATOG leverages **Google Gemini** (1.5 Pro and Flash) as its primary neural engine for complex reasoning, specialist review, and final synthesis.

### Gemini Functions & Integration:
*   **Specialist Specialists**: Specialized agents (Legal, Finance, Tech) utilize Gemini's massive context window to process hundreds of pages of documentation simultaneously.
*   **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Gemini powers the sequential and parallel multi-agent analysis flows, identifying gaps (Findings), suggesting modifications (Corrections), and tracking responsibilities (Obligations).
*   **Dynamic RAG**: Integrates Gemini embeddings for semantic search across the internal Knowledge Base, ensuring agent responses are grounded in enterprise facts.
*   **Vision-Language Analysis**: Gemini Pro Vision is used for layout detection and visual document parsing, understanding tables, charts, and handwritten signatures.

## 🛡️ Security Layer: LobsterTrap Audit Suite

Every communication between CATOG and the AI models is intercepted and inspected by **LobsterTrap**, a local-first security middleware designed for enterprise compliance.

### How LobsterTrap Works:
LobsterTrap operates as a **Deep Prompt Inspection (DPI)** proxy. It ensures that the AI remains helpful while preventing security regressions.

1.  **Ingress Inspection (Request)**:
    *   **Intent Declaration**: CATOG declares the intent of every request (e.g., "enterprise_automation").
    *   **Data Leak Prevention (DLP)**: LobsterTrap scans prompts for sensitive PII, PHI, or internal trade secrets before they leave the secure environment.
    *   **Injection Guard**: Detects and blocks prompt injection patterns that might attempt to hijack the agent's logic.

2.  **Egress Inspection (Response)**:
    *   **Hallucination Detection**: Compares the AI output against the original document context and Knowledge Base evidence to identify factual mismatches.
    *   **Compliance Verdict**: Assigns a security verdict (`ALLOW`, `WARN`, or `DENY`) to every response.
    *   **Chain of Custody**: Generates a cryptographically signed hash for every interaction, ensuring the audit trail is tamper-proof.

### Observability Flow:
*   **Execution Logs**: Every agent task in the "Sequential Flow" includes a LobsterTrap status badge. Users can click the **Audit Report** link to view the raw security metrics and risk scores.
*   **Neural Graph Branch**: The diagram above illustrates the parallel execution of the **Graph Indexing** branch, where entities are extracted into nodes and relationships are mapped in real-time.
*   **System Interface (Terminal)**: Real-time security events are logged to the system terminal, providing a constant visibility of "Security Protocol v2.4" in action.
*   **Analysis Graph**: The interactive Knowledge Graph header displays the current LobsterTrap monitoring status, ensuring all visualized entities are verified.
